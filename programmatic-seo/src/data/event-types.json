Grandma can waltz to Frank Sinatra on Channel 1 while your friends go wild to house music on Channel 3 — all at the same time, on the same dance floor.",

      },
      {
        "question": "What music can we play on the 3 channels?",
        "answer": "Anything you want. Each channel connects to a separate audio source — a DJ, laptop, phone, or mixer. Most wedding couples set up Channel 1 for classics and slow dances, Channel 2 for pop and RnB, and Channel 3 for dance music. Your DJ can manage all three."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do silent disco headphones work with a wedding DJ?",
        "answer": "Yes. Your DJ connects their mixer output to the transmitter. They can manage all 3 channels from their setup, making announcements and controlling the music just like a normal reception — but through headphones instead of speakers."
